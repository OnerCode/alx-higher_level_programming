0x0C. Python - Almost a circle


0. If it's not tested it doesn't work
mandatory
All your files, classes and methods must be unit tested and be PEP 8 validated.

1. Base class
mandatory
Write the first class Base:

Create a folder named models with an empty file __init__.py inside - with this file, the folder will become a Python package

Create a file named models/base.py:

2. First Rectangle
mandatory
Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base:

In the file models/rectangle.py
Class Rectangle inherits from Base
Private instance attributes, each with its own public getter and setter


3. Validate attributes
mandatory
Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (id excluded):

If the input is not an integer, raise the TypeError exception with the message: <name of the attribute> must be an integer. Example: width must be an integer
If width or height is under or equals 0, raise the ValueError exception with the message: <name of the attribute> must be > 0. Example: width must be > 0


4. Area first
mandatory
Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self): that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance.


5. Display #0
mandatory
Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def display(self): that prints in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # - you donâ€™t need to handle x and y here.


6. __str__
mandatory
Update the class Rectangle by overriding the __str__ method so that it returns [Rectangle] (<id>) <x>/<y> - <width>/<height>


7. Display #1
mandatory
Update the class Rectangle by improving the public method def display(self): to print in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # by taking care of x and y


8. Update #0
mandatory
Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def update(self, *args): that assigns an argument to each attribute:

1st argument should be the id attribute
2nd argument should be the width attribute
3rd argument should be the height attribute
4th argument should be the x attribute
5th argument should be the y attribute
